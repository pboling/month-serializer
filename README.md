# Month::Serializer

This gem allows you to convert [Month objects](https://github.com/timcraft/month) into Integers, and vice versa.  This is useful for serializing into other data structures, like String, or to pass values in JSON, or send as parameters to Resque / Sidekiq jobs (which parameters are only compatible with the basic JSON data types).

If you only ever want to test subjects wrapped in blocks, and are comfortable with **losing** the standard `is_expected` behavior, see an alternative to this gem [here](https://github.com/christopheraue/ruby-rspec-is_expected_block/).


### Why use Month instead of Date or Time?

- Month is lighter weight.
- There are many situations where having Months incrementable by 1 is useful
  - e.g. Directly mappable to iteration index
- It facilitates month-based math.
- Adding a day when a day is not relevant, such as for data with a 1 month resolution, can result in very overcomplicated systems that try to work around or ignore the stray days.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'month-serializer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install month-serializer

## Usage

This spec below, copied from the actual test suite, makes usage pretty clear.  Note how the serialized Months as integer increment by one.  If you think about counting time by months this makes sense.  We often speak this way about babies, an 18 month old, or 24 month old.
  
How old is the Common Era right now?  About 24.2k months!  Is a millenimonth, millimes, or kilomonth, a thing?  The Common Era is roughly 24 kilomonths old. 😆  And Neanderthal man went extinct about 471 kilomonths ago.

```ruby
    {
        -471359 => Month.new(-39280, 1),  # hist: Extinction of Neanderthal
        24201 => Month.new(2016, 9),
        24202 => Month.new(2016, 10),
        # ...
        24214 => Month.new(2017, 10),
        24215 => Month.new(2017, 11),
        # ...
        24227 => Month.new(2018, 11),
        24228 => Month.new(2018, 12)
    }.each do |k, v|
           context "#{k} => #{v}" do
             it "Month converts to #{k}" do
               expect(v.to_i).to eq(k)          # to_i is added by this gem!
             end
             context 'round trip' do
               it "can load #{k} to #{v}" do
                 expect(Month.load(k)).to eq(v) # load is added by this gem!
               end
               it "can dump #{v} to #{k}" do
                 expect(Month.dump(v)).to eq(k) # dump is added by this gem!
               end
             end
           end
         end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Versioning

This library aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semver].
Violations of this scheme should be reported as bugs. Specifically,
if a minor or patch version is released that breaks backward
compatibility, a new version should be immediately released that
restores compatibility. Breaking changes to the public API will

dependency on this gem using the [Pessimistic Version Constraint][pvc] with two digits of precision.

    gem 'month-serializer', '~> 1.0', group: :test

or in a `gemspec`

    spec.add_development_dependency 'month-serializer', '~> 1.0'
